    <p>Alec Stewart has the same number of test match runs (8463) as his date of birth (8/4/63). A rare coincidence.
      <br>
      South Africa have won more ODIâ€™s than they have lost against every single opposition that they have come up
      against in the format.
      <br>
      Alastair Cook has scored more T20 centuries (1) than Jos Buttler (0). This, despite Jos Buttler being famed as one
      of the best T20 batsmen in the world, while Alastair Cook is thought to be a test specialist.
      <br>
      Chris Gayle is the only batsman to have smashed a six from the first ball of a test match. It happened against
      Bangladesh in Mirpur in 2012.
      <br>
      Sri Lanka have only won one test match against Australia in their entire history. It came in 1999. They won the
